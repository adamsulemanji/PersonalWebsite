            I'm a software engineer working at Amazon in Seattle, building
            software to connect people to international products.

            In my free time, I love to go outdoors and play any sort of sport.
            Right now, my current fixation is skiing. Next ski season, I plan on
            leveraging the surrounding slopes in Seattle. During the rest of the
            year, I sign up for impromptu races in the area.
